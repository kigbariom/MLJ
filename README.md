An adaptation of the popular game Jenga as a 3D physics game done in Unity 

This game was made so that I could experiment with 3D modeling, physics engines, and a little bit of C# programming.
I have plans to continue work on this game to make it networked for turn based multiplayer so that I can learn networking code.
I have no plans to release this game.
